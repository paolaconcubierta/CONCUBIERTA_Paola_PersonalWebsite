<div class="img-p1">
	<p> First project in Multimedia which I had a hard time because I am not usually into using colors,
		I prefer black and white, and also gray. Which is why I'm taking risk again because I find my website too cute to be true. </p>
</div>

<div class="image-3">

<div class="img-p2">
	<p> Midterm requirements, the legendary line art and vector, I had fun doing this because who doesn't love doing new things.
		But guess what, it is not that easy especially if you don't know what the prof really wants you to do...</p>

<div class="img-p3">
	<p> Well, these are my initial line art and vector, which wasn't good enough, I guess because she doesn't like it (HI MA'AM)
		which is why I end up doing an anime line art because it is much easier for me. hoho</p>

<div class="img-p4">
	<p> And lastly, one of our final project <i>(because we had flash and premiere also which was more fun)</i>, the logo making
		for a cocoa, anything made of cocoa, I think I have chosen wine because aside from its kinda unique, that time we had our oop
		and I think I need some alcohol. I didn't got a perfect score because I didn't have the black line art for it...<b> but 
		I assure you that I do always have an idea for anything clever and fun ideas, themes and yesss logo</b></p>
